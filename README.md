<img src="website/static/images/tag-contributor-strategy-icon-color.png" alt="a line drawing of a busy bee" align=right width="150px">

Contributor Strategy is a [Technical Advisory Group](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/tags/cncf-tags.md) (TAG) responsible for contributor experience, sustainability, governance, and openness guidance to help CNCF community groups
and projects with their own contributor strategies for a healthy project.

If you are looking for how-to resources produced by the TAG, please visit
[contribute.cncf.io](https://contribute.cncf.io/) or have a look at the
contributor, goverance, and related [templates](https://github.com/cncf/project-template).

For people new to this space, you can learn more about [CNCF TAG's](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/tags/cncf-tags.md) by following the link.

The [TAG Contributor Strategy charter](/CHARTER.md) outlines the scope of our group activities. To get involved, our [Contributing Guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md) lays out more details.

## Meetings

We have one general meeting a month, along with meetings for our working groups.
Go to [the CNCF calendar](https://tockify.com/cncf.public.events/monthly?search=Contributor+Strategy) to see when we meet next.

- Calendar invites are sent to the mailing list(see: [Communicating with us](#communicating-with-us)).
Once you join, you won't automatically have the invite on your calendar. You can
get it from a [past message here](https://lists.cncf.io/g/cncf-tag-contributor-strategy/message/1)
- [Meeting minutes and agenda](https://bit.ly/cncf-contribstrat-agenda)

## Communicating with Us

Anyone is welcome to join our open discussions of TAG Contributor Strategy
projects and share news related to the group's mission and charter. Much of the
work of the group happens outside of TAG Contributor Strategy meetings and we
encourage project teams to share progress updates or post questions in these
channels:

- [Mailing list](https://lists.cncf.io/g/cncf-tag-contributor-strategy)
  - The mailing list is used for decisions, announcements, and broad communications
  on record for the entire TAG.
  - Calendar invites will be sent to this address. You can get the calendar
  invite from a [past message here](https://lists.cncf.io/g/cncf-tag-contributor-strategy/message/2)

- [#tag-contributor-strategy](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/CT6CWS1JN) on [CNCF Slack](https://slack.cncf.io/)
  - Real time communication is great! Chat with us here but we might ask you to
  open an issue or remind us on the mailing list so we can have a record.

- [File an Issue](https://github.com/cncf/tag-contributor-strategy)
  - Working on a project? Have an idea for something we/you should work on? Talk
  about a change you'd like to propose?
