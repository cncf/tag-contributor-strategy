# Inclusiveness Groups

Inclusivness is a key value of the CNCF. Accordingly, we have multiple includiveness initiatives, working groups, and communities working on including different groups in the work of Cloud Native. Here is where to find several of them:

- [Deaf and Hard of Hearing Working Group](https://github.com/cncf/tag-contributor-strategy/tree/main/deaf-and-hard-of-hearing), and [Slack channel](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C05BYNK8A3V)
- [Blind and Visually Impaired Initiative](https://github.com/cncf/tag-contributor-strategy/blob/main/blind-and-visually-impaired/README.md): [Slack channel](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C07CPG6AFC7)
- [BIPOC Initiative](https://github.com/cncf/tag-contributor-strategy/blob/main/bipoc/README.md), and [Slack channel](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C07G6EAAKGE)
- [Women in Cloud Native community](https://community.cncf.io/women-in-cloud-native/)
