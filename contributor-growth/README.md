# Contributor Growth

The Contributor Growth working group is interested in assisting CNCF projects
with sustainably growing their contributor base.

## Goals

* Provide best practices and resources for managing and interacting with
  contributors to CNCF projects.
* Provide guidance on a sustainable contributor lifecycle for CNCF Projects to:
  * Develop a pipeline that brings in new contributors.
  * Define a contribution ladder with activities that promote contributors to
    higher levels of responsibility.
  * Support their maintainers with advice and resources that improve sustainability
    and plan for transitions from the project.
    

## Scope

* Templates for common documents like a contributing guide, reviewing guide,
  maintainers guide, contribution ladder, etc.
* Case studies of successful projects of various kinds/sizes and how they manage
  contributions.
* Collect and share talks related to the working group's mission, for example
  building open source communities, or reflections on a particular community's
  best practices.
* Document ways to contribute to a project, especially roles outside of the
  obvious feature enhancement/code contributions.
* Discuss non-code areas that support contributor growth, such as project
  management, design, user experience and documentation and how CNCF projects
  can prioritize work that may not be the maintainers primary skillset.
* Provide materials that a CNCF project can use to address the TOC [due
  diligence guidelines] related to project's contributors and community.

### Out-of-Scope

The following are examples of things out-of-scope:

* Project governance.
* Project automation, such as prow.
* Day to day support for improving the contribution experience for CNCF projects. Instead, CNCF projects should take on this support themselves (for
  example, Kubernetes has SIG Contributor Experience).
