Welcome! Are you interested in contributing to one of CNCF hosted projects? This repository should help you. It contains information and guidelines about contributions to CNCF projects.

CNCF offers multiple ways to start contributing to the CNCF ecosystem, including either foundation-wide and project-wide opportunities.

Though, contributing to the CNCF ecosystem is not just about coding. There are many other ways to contribute to the CNCF ecosystem, including writing documentation, creating tutorials, bringing ideas to meetings, organizing meetups, and more.

## Open Source Beginners

Are you new to open source? If so, we recommend checking out our comprehensive guide, ["Start Contributing to Open Source"](getting-started.md). This guide is filled with helpful tips and tricks to help you get started with contributing to open source projects. You'll learn about communities and projects, how to find them, how to conform to community standards, and much more.

## Contribution Opportunities

### Groups

CNCF Technical Advisory Groups (TAG's) oversee and coordinate the interests pertaining to a logical area of needs of end users and/or projects. More details about the CNCF TAGs is available [here](https://github.com/cncf/toc/tree/main/tags).

Working groups (WG's) are the community-driven groups with the goal of continuous collaboration in the specific areas. CNCF WG's are created and curated by the CNCF TOC and driven by the community members. CNCF TOC repo provides more [details](https://github.com/cncf/toc/tree/master/workinggroups#cncf-working-groups) on the purpose and goals of WG's, together with the [list of them](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/README.md#working-groups).

If you're interested in contributing to a TAG or a WG, be sure to check out their respective repositories for more information.

Remember, group meetings are open to everyone, with no strings attached. You're welcome to join in on the discussions or simply observe the group activities.

### Meetups

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation supports the worldwide community of the Cloud Native meetups. They are listed on [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/pro/cncf/) website.

CNCF is currently working on expanding the Cloud Native community around the globe, and we are happy to accept the new meetup communities to join our network, and become one of the official CNCF meetups.

Are you passionate about Cloud Native technologies and interested in starting a meetup in your area? Look no further than the CNCF Meetups program! Check out the [Meetups repository](https://github.com/cncf/meetups) for more information about the program, including best practices for running successful CNCF Meetups.

### Ambassadors

[Cloud Native Ambassadors](https://www.cncf.io/people/ambassadors/) (CNAs) are individuals who are passionate about [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) technology and projects, recognized for their expertise, and willing to help others learn about the framework and community.

Successful ambassadors are people such as bloggers, influencers, evangelists who are already engaged with a CNCF project in some way including contributing to forums, online groups, community events, etc.

Details on the Ambassadors program, and information on how to join CNCF as an Ambassador is available [here](https://github.com/cncf/ambassadors).
