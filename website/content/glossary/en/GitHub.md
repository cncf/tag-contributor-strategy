## What it is

GitHub is an online software development platform used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects.

It allows developers to store and manage their projects (repositories) in a centralized location, and offers features such as version control, bug tracking, and project management.

GitHub also provides a platform for community collaboration and communication, making it easy for developers to contribute to open-source projects, as well as for organizations to manage their internal development efforts.
