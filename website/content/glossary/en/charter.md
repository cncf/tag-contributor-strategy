## What it is

A project charter can help end users understand how a project fits into the overall ecosystem and what functionality it does / does not offer as compared to the many alternatives. The project charter can take many different forms, and itâ€™s often not called a charter at all, but instead takes the form of a mission statement, scope, values / principles, and similar concepts often found within the governance documents or project READMEs.
