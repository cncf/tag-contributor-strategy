## What it is

A [CNCF Maintainer](https://contribute.cncf.io/about/maintainers-circle/) is an individual who plays a key role in maintaining and managing the development of a specific project within the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). 

Maintainers are responsible for ensuring the quality and stability of the project by reviewing code changes, merging pull requests, triaging bugs, and working with the project's community to make decisions and resolve technical issues. 

They have significant technical expertise in the project and are elected or appointed by the project's Steering Committee or Technical Oversight Committee (TOC). CNCF Maintainers play a critical role in advancing the project and ensuring its long-term success.
