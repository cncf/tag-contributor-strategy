## What it is

CNCF Governance refers to the set of processes, rules, and structures that are in place to govern the activities and decision-making of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). This includes the roles and responsibilities of the Technical Oversight Committee (TOC), Steering Committees of individual projects, Special Interest Groups (SIGs), and the members of the CNCF. The governance framework defines how the CNCF operates and ensures that decisions are made in a transparent and inclusive manner, promoting the growth and stability of the foundation and its projects.
