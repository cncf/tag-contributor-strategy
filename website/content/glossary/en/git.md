## What it is

[Git](https://git-scm.com/about/free-and-open-source) is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. 

In 2005 Linus Torvalds created Git. Git is a decentralized system that can be used to track changes in your source code. In essence, Git can work with copies of the code, so called in branches or forks where you can work in, before your changes get merged back in a main branch.

It is widely used by developers, organizations, and open-source communities. It allows multiple people to work on the same project, track changes to the codebase, and collaborate effectively on development.
