## What it is

Collections of code and other materials, such as documentation and test files, that are used to develop and distribute software. 

A repository (repo) in GitHub is a virtual storage space where all the files, code, and other assets associated with a specific software project are stored and organized. It serves as a centralized location for collaboration and version control of the project's development. 

Each repository contains a unique history of changes and can include code, documentation, and other resources such as images and audio files. Users can view, fork, and contribute to a repository, and the maintainers of the repository have the ability to accept or reject changes through pull requests.

Repositories on GitHub can be either public, meaning anyone can access and contribute to the project, or private, meaning access is limited to specific individuals or organizations. GitHub is widely used by developers, organizations, and open-source communities to host and manage their projects.
