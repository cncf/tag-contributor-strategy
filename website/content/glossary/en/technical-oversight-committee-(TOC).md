## What it is

The governing body of the CNCF Foundation that is responsible for the technical direction of the foundation and its projects.

It admits and oversees all projects in the CNCF Foundation and has a mandate to facilitate driving neutral consensus for:

* Defining and maintaining the technical vision for the Cloud Native Computing Foundation,

* Approving new projects within the scope for CNCF set by the Governing Board (GB), and create a conceptual architecture for the projects, aligning projects, removing or archiving projects,
* Accepting feedback from end user committee and map to projects,
* Aligning interfaces to components under management (code reference implementations before standardizing), and defining common practices to be implemented across CNCF projects, if any.
