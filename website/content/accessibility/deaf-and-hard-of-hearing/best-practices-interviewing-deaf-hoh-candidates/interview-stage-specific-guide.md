Inform the candidates about the format of each interview stage and ask what accommodations they need. Accommodation needs may differ depending on the setup or task. A successful interview also requires a prepared interpreter. The following example demonstrates why preparation needs to be different for each stage:
### General Accommodations
1. **Offer extra time**: Ask if the candidate needs extra time for interviews.
2. **Schedule a 30-minute pre-interview session**: If the candidate and interpreter don't know each other, arrange a meeting between the two so they can familiarize themselves with each other’s signing styles and discuss relevant background information and interview expectations.
3. **Suggest accommodation options**: If your company has an Accessibility or Accommodation team, consult with them about optimal accommodation. Some candidates may have only done a few job interviews in their lives, and they might not fully understand their needs before the interview either. 
### Interview Stage Accommodations
**CV walkthrough**: This discussion typically covers a broad vocabulary to describe past projects and technologies. The interpreter will need to familiarize themselves with the CV and project list in advance and get a chance to ask for clarification (e.g., technical terms like Kubernetes, CI/CD, etc.).

**Technical interview**: The interview will likely cover technical jargon specific to the role and the candidate’s background. The candidate will need to familiarize the interpreters with relevant terms in advance. For example, in an infrastructure-related conversation, the interpreters would need to be prepared for terms like OpenTofu, state file, drift, modules, and other concepts unique to the domain.

**Live coding**: This can be challenging. The candidate will need to type and sign simultaneously. There will be interruptions for clarification, and the candidate will likely be monitoring captions to ensure interpretation accuracy. Interpreters are often unfamiliar with jargon like “Big O notation,” “O(nlogn),” or “linked list” and will likely struggle to follow and interrupt for clarifications.
- **Consider a take-home assignment**: This allows the candidate to work without communication barriers and interruptions. Schedule a follow-up session where the candidate can walk through their code and answer follow-up questions.
- **If live coding is mandatory**:
    - Allow extra time to account for interpretation delays, interruptions, and increased cognitive load.
    - Provide the candidate with uninterrupted time to complete each coding section.
    - Discuss and ask follow-up questions about their logic and design choices sequentially after each coding section is finished to help the candidate maintain focus during problem-solving and articulate their reasoning in a more structured way.

**System Design**: Topics may vary widely, and the required vocabulary changes dramatically based on the specific problem domain. This makes it very challenging for the candidate to prepare the interpreter without prior knowledge of the area that will be covered. Interpreters prepared for generic questions will be lost in a specialized discussion, which may be perceived as if the candidate is less knowledgeable. 

Without giving away questions, inform the candidate about the topic areas that will be covered (e.g., Kubernetes' focused design, data-intensive design, or cloud-related design). This allows the candidate to ensure the interpreter is aware of key signs and concepts for the specific domain. Many domain-specific terms (e.g., pod, Argo, canary) lack standardized signs; a deaf candidate will often need to fingerspell or draw and explain using simplified language for the interpreter to convey the concept accurately.
- **Use visual collaboration tools**: Use an interactive platform (e.g., a diagramming whiteboard) that allows the candidate to draw solutions on a shared screen. Also, if you are using specialized software, inform the candidate so they can practice and avoid friction during the interview.
- **Offer written responses**: Offer the option to respond in writing using a shared document or chat. The candidate can then choose to write, sign, or use a combination of both, allowing them to express their thoughts flexibly.

In short, the information is not to give candidates an edge but rather to ensure the interpreter is ready for the task. **The best candidate is only as good as the interpreter is prepared**. Unfortunately, bad interpreter performance is often attributed to the candidate.
