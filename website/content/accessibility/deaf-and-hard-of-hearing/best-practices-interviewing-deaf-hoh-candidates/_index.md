### Introduction
Accommodation needs vary depending on the interviewee. Deaf individuals may use sign language, speak and lip-read, use captions, or communicate in writing. Hard of hearing interviewees may hear but still rely on additional cues (e.g., lip-reading, captions). In-person and virtual interviews each present unique opportunities and challenges. Please review all relevant sections in advance so you have time to ask the interviewee about necessary accommodations and set everything up to ensure a smooth experience for both parties.

#### Never Assume; Always Ask!

When it comes to interviewing a deaf or hard of hearing candidate, the most important thing is **never to assume and always to ask the candidate about their needs and preferences**. Always ask the deaf candidate directly (or via the HR or accessibility team) what accommodations and communication methods work best for them.
Job interviews are stressful enough, and placing a candidate in an uncomfortable situation may jeopardize their chances of a fair process. Deaf and hard of hearing individuals already face many barriers. Please do your best to make the process smooth **at every stage of the interview** to ensure their full participation and optimal performance.
