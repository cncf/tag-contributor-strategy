Once a month, we welcome you to a maintainers circle: a peer group that will
meet with scheduled topics, ample discussion, and networking time for fellow
reviewers, approvers, maintainers, and other core leaders of CNCF projects. This
is a time for you to stay connected, learn from and with each other, and discuss
topics that are close to you. We'll have a 100 person capacity for each event
and depending on demand, may re-run the session. The capacity is set to make
sure everyone that wants an interactive experience vs a lecture can have one.

The only contract of the members of each circle is to abide by the CNCF Code of
Conduct, be kind, open as you'd like, and committed to hearing others out.
Everyone will have a chance to participate in whatever activity is set forth in
that meeting.

## Who is a maintainer?

<div class="text-left">
There are a lot of meanings within the community. A maintainer is anyone
recognized as a maintainer or in a core role of a CNCF project by that project's
standards and governance. You can maintain code, docs, policy and more, but you
are making decisions.

Relevant CNCF project examples:
- [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/project/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md#maintainership)
lists maintainers and code reviewers as key role
- [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.md)
lists maintainers in a MAINTAINERS.md file
- [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/community-membership.md)
doesn't use the word maintainer but uses an OWNERs file method for ownership by
listing reviewers and approvers

We recognize the term does not apply across the board perfectly. Maintainers
is an umbrella succinct term that covers many of your roles and inclusivity.

Important note: CNCF has a pool of listed maintainers for each project that vote
on behalf of their project in TOC elections. Some projects have more maintainer
roles than this and the Circle welcomes all decision makers.
