Mentoring Working Group is a group of people who focus on mentorship initiatives to encourage the adoption of cloud native computing. Our mission is to provide opportunities for new contributors to work on CNCF projects with experienced mentorship, which helps promote project growth and sustainability. We also offer support and advice to CNCF projects around mentorship initiatives.

Here are some benefits that the Mentoring working group can provide to communities:
