Mentoring Working Group is a group of people who focus on mentorship initiatives to encourage the adoption of cloud native computing. Our mission is to provide opportunities for new contributors to work on CNCF projects with experienced mentorship, which helps to promote growth and sustainability of projects. We also provide support and advice to CNCF projects around mentorship initiatives.
