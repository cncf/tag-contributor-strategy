Missing, and Unknown.
* Complete - the content of the governance documentation is fully detailed and does not leave any question to the reader.
* Partial - the content of the governance documentation is missing some information and would leave the reader 
  with questions or some level of misunderstanding.
* Missing - the documentation is absent, wholly undiscoverable, or woefully inadequate in meeting the objectives 
  of that governance content. The reader cannot act on the content that is available.
* Unknown - status cannot be assessed at this time
