TODO is an open community of practitioners who aim to create and share knowledge and collaborate on practices and tools to run successful Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs). There is usually overlaping areas of interest within OSPOs and individual contributors. TODO has a [Get Started](https://todogroup.org/community/get-started/) page if you want to get more involved.
