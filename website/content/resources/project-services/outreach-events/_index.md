* Submissions for call-for-proposals at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon are encouraged to discuss their use of CNCF projects.
* CNCF sponsors industry and [Linux Foundation events](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/) each year, often with a booth. We encourage project maintainers to join CNCF in our participation to meet with the event attendees and talk about your project.
** Project contributors are welcome to use our booth as a "home base" for meeting colleagues.
* Connect to our worldwide network of [Cloud Native Community Groups](https://community.cncf.io/) and [Ambassadors](https://www.cncf.io/people/ambassadors/) to raise awareness of your project.
* Travel funding is available for your non-corporate-backed developers. Please visit our most recent events' need-based scholarship page to learn about eligibility.
* At events, we promote all CNCF projects and help connect users and developers to our projects.
