## Marketing announcements for projects

As projects have major or minor releases or move through the [maturity levels](https://www.cncf.io/projects/), CNCF works with the projects on outbound communications. Below are the items we can do with you.

### Project entering and moving through the maturity levels

Every project has different needs and staff works with projects based on those needs. Below are the services offered as a project moves through the different graduation levels and the support for graduated and incubating project releases.

#### Graduation

- Press release announcement
