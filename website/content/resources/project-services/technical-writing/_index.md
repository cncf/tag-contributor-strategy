The CNCF makes significant investments each year to improve project documentation. These include the following:

- [Documentation analysis](https://github.com/cncf/techdocs/tree/main/analyses) to help projects understand where to make improvementsâ€”Website hosting and setup
- [Monthly Q&A sessions](https://github.com/cncf/techdocs#office-hours) for face-to-face time with writers
- Technical writers and contractors for specific projects

For a complete description of the technical documentation team's offerings, see [documentation services for projects](https://github.com/cncf/techdocs/blob/main/docs/services.md).

Documentation examples include:

- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) (i18n support and case studies)

- [gRPC](https://grpc.io) (full redesign and contracted tech writing support)
