title: Update a Project in the CNCF Landscape
---

Project information like website URLs, graduation and incubation dates, and other crucial information about projects is maintained at [landscape.cncf.io](https://l.cncf.io).

Updates to project entries can be submitted via [the CNCF Landscape GitHub repository](https://github.com/cncf/landscape/). 

Note: It's (relatively) straightforward to update existing entries, but adding a new entry is less so. Please read the [guide provided in the repo](https://github.com/cncf/landscape/?tab=readme-ov-file#new-entries)
