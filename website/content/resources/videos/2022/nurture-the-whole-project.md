Your code is reviewed, docs are being written, and the CNCF is hosting an event for you. What else does an open source project need?

As it turns out, a lot. You need to deliberately create a welcoming community, publicize your project, manage contributors' expectations, motivate them to take on more responsibility, develop project policies and processes, and more. With so many things to tackle, it can feel overwhelming. Fortunately, lots of people have done this before — and the CNCF and TAG Contributor Strategy are here to help.
